# Modified Gridentify

This game is inspired by [Gridentify](https://gridentify.com/) with the addition of the preview of next 5 numbers (configurable in code). This allows the users to make strategic choices on the next moves and gave them more control on the schema. The game should feel less random and it should encourage a slower playing pace.

## How to play

Draw on equal number on the 5 by 5 below. The last number you select get replaced by the sum of the number you selected. The others get pulled from the preview row on top (left to right).

## Commands

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

**There are no test script at this time, so the test script is not useful**

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
